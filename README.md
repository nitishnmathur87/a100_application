A100 Apprentice Application Form

Updated frond end form. The login and register module need to be integrated along with this front end form.

Only Insert statements work as of now. Another branch created for pulling data from the database. Merge conflicts are there which need to be rectified. 

PDO is used for the PHP functionality.

The complete front end form is done in Twitter Bootstrap framework.
